# Logger Code Review

Thu Mar 12 2015

## Tests
- The tests aren't functional
- Align the tests with the current implementation

## SimpleLogger
- This is more of an elaborate product name that a class named for its concern
- This is a logger that writes using `puts`
- `PutsLogger` is inappropriate because `puts` is an informal shortcut for `STDOUT`
- Should be `STDERRLogger`
- However, diagnostics *should not* be written to stdout. They should be written to `STDERR`.
- So, this should be `STDERRLogger`
- However, we already know that due to a mistake in Vert.x that we need to write to `STDOUT`
- At best, this is a `ConsoleLogger`
- This is reinforced by the existing hints in the existing (now deactivated) design.
- It should continue to be switchable between STDERR and STDOUT based on the existing (now deactivated) mechanism of the CONSOLE_DEVICE environment variable, eg: CONSOLE_DEVICE=stdout
- Implementation should include a ConsoleLogger::Defaults.device that returns the STDERR object
- `SimpleLogger` will be referred to as `ConsoleLogger` for the rest of this document

## ConsoleLogger File System Location
- The `logger.rb` file is not the host of the logger. It's the implementation of the outer `Logger` module.
- The `ConsoleLogger` should be in its own file rather than appropriating the `logger.rb` file, which is of a different concern.

## Attributes
- The `level` and `name` attributes are not likely attr_accessors
- They are initializer arguments, which indicates that they are attr_reader attributes

## LEVELS
- The levels are not a constant
- The levels should be implemented as a method
- They are subject to change before the end of time
- Constants are for things that are not ever nor ever will be subject to change due to design or requirements changes, eg: Pi or Avogadro's Number
- Constants harm testability when used inappropriately as constants should never be overridden for the purposes of proving failure paths
- Methods are more readily replaced for the purposes of testing
- There is almost nothing in a business application that is in fact a constant
- Most uses of constants are de facto design mistakes unless modeling something that is a universal, timeless "constant"

## Logic in the Initializer
- The initializer should only be executed when all of the data is ready
- The data isn't ready at the time of construction
- That's known because the initializer executes `@name = name_for(subject)` and `@level = LEVELS.index(level)`
- Don't derive values in an initializer. Only capture values in an initializer. The only exception is setting an optional argument to a primitive value.
- The `@name = name_for(subject)` is factory method logic, eg: A `build` method
- The `@level = LEVELS.index(level)` is also factory method logic

## Assigning the default
- The default level shouldn't be assigned in `get`, which is a method that invokes construction, but is not itself a construction concern
- Once the logic is out of the initializer, the assignment of the default will find a more natural home that will likely reflect instances of this pattern throughout the system.

## Logger#register
- This method really doesn't make sense anymore unless the loggers are recorded inside the Logger namespace, and re-used rather than reconstructed
- This isn't an issue of small object creation, but rather an issue of the code standing on its own and making sense in and of itself
- This should either be made to work as designed, or removed, but not left as the kind of vestigial organ that promotes permissiveness in code rot.

## Line Format
- The line format changed in the replacement of TwP's Logging::Logger with the current emergency stop-gap implementation
- The line format that was lost in the rapid-response implementation is:
[{time}] {class name | string name} {level.upcase}: {message}

## Logger Name
- The logger name is the class name of the subject if the subject is a class
- Otherwise, the logger name is assumed to be a string

## Logger#configure
- This is a long-standing design flaw in the Logger interface that predates recent changes, but the `subject` and `receiver` parameter order should be inverted

## Null Object
- The construction of the null logger no longer makes sense for its design
- Both the null logger and the logger itself should be based off of a common interface
- That interface should have just the level writer methods
- The interface should be implemented as a module, where the methods delegate to the device (or ideally, a writer)
- The module should be used as the basis for the null object
- The null object should not have the explicit definitions of the level writer methods within it
- Those definitions are there only because the Logging::Logger was created dynamically
- I.e.: The current implementation of the null object is coupled to a library that is no longer in use, and won't be used in the future. This leaves behind more questions than it answers, and leaves ambiguity that following contributors will need to clear (or at least, they should) before proceeding with any work.
